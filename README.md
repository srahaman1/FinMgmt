# Financial Management Code
I created this because I wanted a way to streamline all my areas of finance: income, expenses, credit cards, etc. Essentially this is to track my finances and create a way to easily establish/follow budgets.

I began this endeavor because the analytics for my bank and credit card statements were not as granular or presented in a way that I liked. So I attempted to create those graphs and charts on my own through python.

Previously, I would track my finances in an excel sheet which worked fairly well but I wanted to see if there were any ways that I could use python to improve those spreadsheets. Or at least, I could mimic the creation of those spreadsheets using python as a side project.
